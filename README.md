# Menelaus

A firmware for the
[Atreus](http://atreus.technomancy.us) keyboard, written in
[Microscheme](http://ryansuchocki.github.io/microscheme/).

Written in an incremental style. Requires microscheme newer than 0.8; at
the time of this writing only available on git master.

Currently only supports the standard PCB-based Atreus pinout; support
for Teensy models will be added later.
